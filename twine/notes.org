* Twine notes
[[https://twine2.neocities.org/2.html][Twine Reference]]

** Basic syntax
   Links are of the form (\ to escape org mode, not twine)
   \[\[Description -> segmentName\]\]

   **Bold**
   *Italics*
   <u>Underlined</u>
   ~~strikethrough~~
   blah^^superscript^^
   Escape chars with ''

** Macros
   In parens, of form (macroName: data)
   Case-, cash-, underscore- insensitive

   Can assign macros to variables:
   (set $aMacro to (font: "Skia"))
   
** Variables
   $aVar
   
   (num:) - make a number, eg: (if: (num: "5") > 2)
   (a:)   - make an array, eg: (a: 2,3,4), 
   
   (set: $aVar to 5)
   (set: $aVar to 5, $anotherVar to "bob")

   (put: 5 into $aVar)

   (move: $aVar into $anotherVar) // $aVar is deleted
   (move: $anArr's 1st into $anotherVar)

** Strings
   String concat works with +
   
   
** Hooks
   [ This is a hook. ]. Essentially a *text closure*

   *Named hooks*: Syntax <name|
   [This hook is named.]<opener|

   Macros can operate on hooks:
   (font: "Courier New")[ this is an anonymous hook.]
   $aMacro[This is other text.]

   Remotely refer to and alter named hooks:
   (click:) eg: (click ?opener)[ aweg ]
   (replace:) 
   

** Conditionals 
   
   (if: $x is 2)[ Print this. ]
   (else:) [ Blahhh ]

   (unless:)
   (else-if:)
   (either:)

** Data Structures:

   (a:) -- an array
   (datamap:) -- dictionary
   (dataset:)
   (count:)
   (datanames:)
   (datavalues:)
   (range:)
   (rotated:)
   (shuffled:)
   (sorted:)
   (subarray:)


** Formatting:
   Bullet lists using *'s to mark the level of indenting
   Numbered lists use 0.'s (eg: 0.0.0. is three indents deep)

   Alignment:
   ==> Right Align
   <== Left Align
   <==> Justified
   =><= centered
   =><==== ratio indented
   ====><== another ratio indented

   #Heading level 1
   ##Heading level2 ....

   ------  : Horizontal line


   {
   	Use braces to collapse whitespace
   }

   Force a line break\
