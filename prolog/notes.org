** Heuristics 
   Never write as the leftmost goal of the body something that is 
   identical with the goal given in the head, place those clauses
   as far right as possible.

   Use Tail Recursion

   Arithmetic comparisons implicitly evaluate both sides.


   #+begin_src prolog
   4 = 4.     %% True
   2+2 = 4.   %% False
   2+2 =:= 4. %% True
   #+end_src


*** Instantiation error
    From trying to do 12 is (X+3)*2
    Where uninstantiated variables are on the right of 'is'.

*** Multiple Files:
    Module:
    #+begin_src prolog
    :- module(MODULE_NAME, [MODULE_EXPORTS/0]).
    #+end_src
    And use:
    #+begin_src prolog
    :- use_module(MODULE_NAME).
    MODULE_NAME:MODULE_EXPORTS.
    #+end_src
** Debugging
   See swipl [[http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=debugoverview][debugger]] and the gnu prolog [[http://gprolog.univ-paris1.fr/manual/gprolog.html#Running-and-stopping-the-debugger][debugger]] 
   #+begin_src prolog
     %% Debugger ports are: call, exit, redo, fail.
     %% Which to show:
     visible(+all).
     %% Which not to halt on:
     leash(-exit).
     %% Trace the next query:
     trace.
   #+end_src

   Commands:
   L : Listing
   g : goals
   C : show context
   A : alternatives
   
   Also print all listings with:
   #+begin_src prolog
   listing.
   #+end_src

** Syntax
   3 basic constructs: Facts, Rules, and Queries
   #+begin_src prolog
     %% Facts start lower case.
     a_face.
     %% Variables start Upper case.
     %% Statements conclude with '.'.
     %% if (body) then (head).
     head :- body.
     %% AND two conditions using a comma: (cond1), (cond2).
     head :- body1, body2.

     %% OR two conditions using a semicolon: (cond1); (cond2).
     head :- body1 ; body2.
   #+end_src

** Unification

    If term1 and term2 are constants, then term1 and term2 unify if
    and only if they are the same atom, or the same number.

    If term1 is a variable and term2 is any type of term, then term1
    and term2 unify, and term1 is instantiated to term2 . Similarly,
    if term2 is a variable and term1 is any type of term, then term1
    and term2 unify, and term2 is instantiated to term1 . (So if they
    are both variables, theyâ€™re both instantiated to each other, and
    we say that they share values.)

    If term1 and term2 are complex terms, then they unify if and only if:
        They have the same functor and arity, and
        all their corresponding arguments unify, and
        the variable instantiations are compatible.
        (For example, it is not possible to instantiate variable X to mia when unifying one pair of arguments, and to instantiate X to vincent when unifying another pair of arguments .)
    Two terms unify if and only if it follows from the previous three clauses that they unify.

    Prolog unification skips occur check. (So does not guard against variables unifying with terms that 
    contain the variable).

** Predicates
   is/2
   =/2
   unify_with_occurs_check/2
   addLen/3

** Lists
   #+begin_src prolog
   [name(bob), name(bill), [1,2,3,4]]
   %% Prolog as a separation operator
   [Head|Tail] = [mia, vincent, jules, yolanda].
   #+end_src


** DCGs
   #+begin_src prolog
   a --> b, c.
   b --> [hello].
   c --> [bob].
   c --> [bill].
   #+end_src
   Is syntactic sugar for difference list rules:
   #+begin_src prolog
   a(X,Y) --> b(X,Z),(Z,Y).
   b(X,[]) --> [bob].
   b(X,[]) --> [bill].
   #+end_src
   DCGs can have extra arguments, and can call additional code.
   #+begin_src 
   a(Count) --> [b], { Count = 1 }.
   #+end_src
   Which can allow separation of lexicon from the rules:
   #+begin_src prolog
   np --> det, n.
   vp --> v, np.
   vp --> v.

   det --> [Word],{lex(Word,det)}.
   n --> [Word],{lex(Word,n)}.
   v --> [Word],{lex(Word,v)}.

   lex(the,det).
   lex(a,det).
   lex(woman,n).
   lex(man,n).
   lex(shoots,v).
   #+end_src
