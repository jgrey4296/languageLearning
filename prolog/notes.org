* Prolog Notes
** Syntax
   3 basic constructs: Facts, Rules, and Queries

   Facts start lower case. Variables start Upper case.
   Statements conclude with '.'.
   Rules of form (head) :- (body). So if (body) then (head).
   AND two conditions using a comma: (cond1), (cond2).
   OR two conditions using a semicolon: (cond1); (cond2).
** Unification

    If term1 and term2 are constants, then term1 and term2 unify if
    and only if they are the same atom, or the same number.

    If term1 is a variable and term2 is any type of term, then term1
    and term2 unify, and term1 is instantiated to term2 . Similarly,
    if term2 is a variable and term1 is any type of term, then term1
    and term2 unify, and term2 is instantiated to term1 . (So if they
    are both variables, theyâ€™re both instantiated to each other, and
    we say that they share values.)

    If term1 and term2 are complex terms, then they unify if and only if:
        They have the same functor and arity, and
        all their corresponding arguments unify, and
        the variable instantiations are compatible.
        (For example, it is not possible to instantiate variable X to mia when unifying one pair of arguments, and to instantiate X to vincent when unifying another pair of arguments .)
    Two terms unify if and only if it follows from the previous three clauses that they unify.

    Prolog unification skips occur check. (So does not guard against variables unifying with terms that 
    contain the variable).
