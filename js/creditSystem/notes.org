* Credit System
** Purpose
To create a simple credit system. Specify some characters,
add debts between them, and let them pay back the debts, or transfer
debts between each other.

** Source
The source is a single file: CreditSystem.js
It defines an object that keeps track of individuals, giving them a
unique id, and then storing their credits and debts separately. 
** Tests
** TODO List
*** Implement Interest
**** Simple interest
Final Amount = Principle * ( 1 + rate * years)
**** Compound interest
Final Amount = Principle * (1 + r) ^ years
*** Implement distinction between principle and interest
*** Store debts separately
*** Abstract Currency System to allow different forms
*** Abstract debts and credits to different, separate categories
