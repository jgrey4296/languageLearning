* Fluxus notes and plan
** Notes
*** File IO
Use `find-system-path` to get the home directory, 
open the file with (open=output-file fileName #:exists `truncate)
or `extend?
write using (display text outputPort) or (fprintf outPort text)
*** Frame Dumping
use (framedump filename)
*** Sequencing
Sequence actions using `begin`
can do everything in a list with (let ([i list]) (stuff))
*** Pdata
    pdata of primitives are vertices. Elements of the pdata:
    t -> texture
    p -> position
    c -> color

** Plan
*** DONE Load and execute file
*** TODO create a chair
*** DONE Export / write to file
*** TODO mess with set-searchpaths and get-searchpaths
