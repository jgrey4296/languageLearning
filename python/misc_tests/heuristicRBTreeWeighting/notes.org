Let R be the ranking of N items, with c being the centre neutral point,
where there can be M <= N bins of ranks with at least 1 rank in each bin.

Dir(R, c, Max, Min) is the directed ranking vector of N entries:
	The lowest rank has value Min,
	rank c has value 0,
    The highest rank has value Max,
    with the invariant min <= c <= max?

Rank Values are spaced range(min,max) either linearly, exponentially, or logarithmically
Rank values are spaced to skip values based on bin size. (ie: two items in rank 1 means rank 2 will be skipped then slot 3 is used)
Either from top down, bottom up, or centre out.

Mod(Dir(R...)) is a modifying function that shifts individual items up or down, with guards as to what they can't supersede, subsede,
or stray from, producing Dir'(R..)


A node in the MC Tree has a vector of probabilities for N, P(N).
P(N) . Dir(R) gives a scalar value that scales the weight of each effect by its likelihood,
