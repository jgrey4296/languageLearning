* Multi-Pass Sieve for Coreference Resolution Notes (cite:Raghunathan2010)
** Candidate Selection
   Sort list of candidates by:
   1) Same Sentence, Left-To-Right BFS of trees
      (L2R favours subjects, BFS favours salience)
      (Repeat for each clause)
   2a) For nominal mentions:  Previous Sentence, Right-To-Left, BFS
   (Favours salience, and proximity)
   2b) For pronominal mentionals: Left-To-Right
   (Favours subjects)
** Attribute Union
   Union all detected attributes of mentions
** Mention Selection
   Per layer, Resolve only mentions first in textual order for cluster
** Search Pruning
   Disable mentions starting with indefinite articles and pronouns
   *Except* in the first pass
** Layers:
*** Exact Match
    Including modifiers and determiners
*** Precise Constructs
    1) Appositive constructions
       eg: [Israel's Deputy Defense Minister], [Ephraim Sneh], said...
    2) Predicate nominative: copulative subject-object relation
       eg: [The New York-based College Board] is [a non profit organization]...
    3) Role Appositive: Antecedent is headed by a noun and appears as a modifier in a NP
       eg: [[actress] Rebecca Schaeffer]
       Only if antecedent is animate, a person, and gender is defined.
    4) Relative Pronoun
       eg: [the finance street [which] has already formed]
    5) Acronym: Both mentions tagged as NNP and one is an acronym of the other
       eg: [Agence France Presse]... [AFP]
    6) Demonym:
       eg: [Israel]... [Israeli]
*** Strict Head Matching
    Match all in order to yield a link:
    1) Match any head in antecedent cluster
    2) Word Inclusion (all non-stop words)
       eg: intervene in the [Florida Supreme Court]'s move... by [the Florida court]...
    3) Compatible modifiers only
       mentions modifiers are all included in modifiers of antecedent candidate
       only modifiers that are nouns or adjectives
    4) Not I within I : Cannot be a child NP in the others NP constituent
*** Variants of Strict Head removing select constraints
*** Relaxed Head Matchiing
    Allow mention head to match any word in the cluster of the candidate antecedent
    eg: Sanders matches to cluster { Sauls, the judge, Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls }
    Requires Mention and Antecedent be named entities of matching type
*** Pronouns
    Enforce agreement on attributes:
    1) Number / Plurality
    2) Gender
    3) Person (apart from within quotes)
    4) Animacy
