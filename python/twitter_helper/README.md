* Twitter Link Opener

A Simple python program that opens a twitter tweet archive json downloaded from twitter,
and for each tweet will trigger tor to search for the tweet text, and open any url in the tweet.

Tweets are loaded from a data directory, and are accessed randomly. I pickle the set of tweet id's 
which i have already processed so I don't do duplicates. 

This is entirely for me to bookmark the ~5000 links i've posted to twitter.
