* Notes on Tweet parsing etc
** Twitters tweet format
   A Downloaded tweet archive contains a .js that is actually the json data of all tweets.
   The first line is a non-spec string to do with twitter's grailbird. So read a single line in,
   discard it, then the rest can be read in and parsed as json. 

** Opening tabs in firefox and tor

   OSX can open apps from the commandline with "open -a {}",
   and with "open -a {} --args {}" you can pass arguments in to the app.
   Which can work with firefox to create new tabs and search.
   That doesn't work for Tor however, despite using firefox under the hood.
   So construct a search with a search engine, joining individual words together with "+",
   to make a valid search url.
