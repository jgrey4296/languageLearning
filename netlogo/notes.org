** Interface Elements
   Buttons (blue): setup and start/stop model
   Sliders / Switches (green): alter model settings
   Monitors and plots (beige): display data
** Components
   Patches : the world grid
   Turtles : The agents
   Links   : Connect two turtles
   Observer: Sees all, can effect all
** Variables
   globals [var1 var2]
   turtles-own [var1 var2]
   patches-own [var1 var2]
   links-own [var1]

   ;;set them with:
   set var val

   ;;get them with:
   [var] of agent ident

   ;;local variables use 'let':
   let lname [varname] of agent

** Procedures
Start with 'to', finish with 'end'.

to something [var1 var2]
	let something 
end

** Creating agents
   hatch ;;from an existing turtle
   sprout ;;from an existing patch
   

** Asking
   ;; ask gives commands to all agents of a group
   ask turtles [ set color red ]

   
** Agentset
   ;;excluding current agent:
   other turtles
   other turtles-here
   ;;filtering:
   turtles with [color = red]
   ;;on the same patch:
   turtles-here with [color = red]
   ;;nearby:
   turtles in-radius 3
   neighbors4
   
*** Commands on agentsets
    ask
    any? ;; is empty?
    all? ;; check for all satisfying a condition
    count
    one-of ;; randomly pick
    

** Breeds
   ;;Simple agent type system
   ;; define agentset and individual
   breed [wolves wolf]
   breed [sheep a-sheep] 

   create-<breed>
   hatch-<breed>
   sprout-<breed>
   <breed>-here
   <breed>-at
   <breed>-on
   is-a-<breed>?

   ;;define vars of a breed:
   <breed>-own
