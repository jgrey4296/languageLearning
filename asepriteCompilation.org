* Compiling Aseprite from source
  Follow the instructions to install google depot_tools, then skia.
  The missing instruction is to *unset python3 and anaconda in the path* 
  as depot_tools, and the setup script for skia uses *python 2*.
  after that, compilation is straight forward, making sure to target the 
  OSX version you are actually on.
